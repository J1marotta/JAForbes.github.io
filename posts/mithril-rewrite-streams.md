Stream Misconceptions: 
----------------------

Client side streams are not about handling real time server side data.
They are about streamlining real time user interactions as data.

Cross Component Communication
-----------------------------

Data Oriented Design
--------------------

1. Mike Acton: "If you have a different dataset, you need a different algorithm"
2. Abstractions are useful, but the wrong abstraction is harmful
3. Choose Data structures most applicable to problem
4. Virtual DOM is conceptually a transform stream
5. Streams are the lowest level abstractiobn that makes sense
6. Makes constant changes to your algorithm easier
7. Immutability by default, mutability is simple when tuning performance
8. Remove unnecessary model calculations from redraw (logicless view)
9. Treat entire app as a series of transform streams reduced into a view

CycleJS and Elm

React, "Reactive" and "Unidirectional Data Flow"
